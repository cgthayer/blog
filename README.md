# My Blog

This is an experimental space to try Hugo with a personal and targeted
blog.  The personal space is tied to Obsidian as a vault and let's me
write and share with specific people in a safe (Dark Forest). The
professional blog is targeted at AI software engineers and those
wishing to get up to speed with AI and LLM technology.
