At a simple level, evals are how we test AI systems, but the term evals covers a lot of ground. In reality there are lots of types of tests mainly grounded in an ML background. Let me explain. First there's online vs offline, then there's human vs LLM-as-a-judge, so that gives us 4 flavors off the bat. Plus there's RAG which looks more like search bench-marking with it's accuracy, precision, and recall. On top of these there are a variety of standard testing approaches and styles.
