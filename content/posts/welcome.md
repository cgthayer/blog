This is a personal blog for Charles Thayer (see also https://thayer.b2si.com). I practice and draft writing here. It's in Hugo, with editing in Obsidian.
### About Me
I'm a software engineer, and sometimes founder. I like to tinkerer, build, think about thinking, and generally play with The Internet and related technologies.
