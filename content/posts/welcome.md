This is a personal blog for Charles Thayer (see also https://thayer.b2si.com). I practice writing here, and capture ideas which sometimes evolve into articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@charles-thayer), [Substack](https://substack.com/@charlesthayer/posts), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/charlesthayer/submitted/), etc.. It's in Hugo, with editing in Obsidian.

### About Me
I'm an AI software engineer, and sometimes founder. I like to tinkerer, build, think about thinking, and generally play with The Internet and related technologies.

**Welcome!** 🌞☕𝛗
